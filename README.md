Introduction to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and investigating the effects of its parameters on how the network works

This repository contains an introduction to CNNs and investigate the effects of the following aspects on how the network works:
* number of convolutional layers
* number of kernels
* size of kernels
* downsampling
* regularization

#### Final Model
```
NUMBER_OF_EPOCHS = 100
BATCH_SIZE = 64'
ACTIVATION_FUNCTIONS = ReLU
NUMBER_OF_KERNELS = 32->32->64->64->128->128
SIZE_OF_KERNELS = 5*5
MAX_POOLING = 2*2
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.2
OPTIMIZAION = ADAM
